# About

Muxup.com is created and maintained by [Alex
Bradbury](https://twitter.com/asbradbury). It aims to serve as a technical blog and
index to my open source projects. See also: Muxup [on
Github](https://github.com/muxup) and [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/muxup).

## Copyright

Unless otherwise noted, all content is released under the [Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The drawn images in
the footer are taken from Google's [Quick, Draw!
dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) (also

## Site structure

Pages that are intended to be continually updated are at unprefixed paths
(e.g. `/foo`), otherwise pages are placed in a sub-directory reflecting the
date (year+quarter) they were published (e.g. `/2022q3/foo`).

When a page receives updates after its initial publication, a short summary of
the changes is displayed under the "Article changelog" heading. If the changes
are not marked as being minor, the page will be moved to the top of the home
page and RSS feed.

## Implementation notes

Muxup.com is a static site generated by a simple Python script and served
using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).
I used [Mistletoe](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe) for Markdown
parsing (with [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) providing syntax highlighting
for code blocks) but otherwise have very few dependencies outside of the
standard library. The [variable version of
the Nunito
font](https://github.com/googlefonts/nunito/tree/main/fonts/variable) is used
throughout the site. I've written a small amount of JS (minified by
[terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) in order to provide
prefetching of internal links and the highlighter effect used for titles.

The design and CSS that implements it is my own and hopefully meets the goal
of cleanly displaying primarily textual content without getting in the way,
while adding a splash of colour and personality.

See [Muxup implementation notes](/pages/2022q3/muxup-implementation-notes.md)
for further implementation details.

## Why the doodlers in the footer?

Muxup is a hobby site and I wouldn't want it to appear too corporate - crudely
drawn doodles of animals are a well known method to avoid this risk. The
[Quick, Draw!
dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) provides a
rich source of such images and means I don't have to expose my own terrible
drawing skills to the internet.
